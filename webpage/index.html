        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ian Anderson. I am a senior in high school, and have been in the computer science program for 4 years. Of those 4 years, i only spent in school for 2, due to the covid pandemic. Throughout those 2 years that we were stuck in our homes, I struggled to find my way back to school, and was often distracted during my Sophomore and Junior year. My struggle comes with the ability to overcome, and although I may not be the best at my job, I can still get the job done. Ever since I was a kid, I've had a liking to video games. Whether it was some random kid game my parents got me at some book store, or if it was just watching videos, I loved the idea of video games. So, that love for video games made me want to get my feet wet and get into computer science. Now I'll admit,  </p>
        <p>Growing up in Louisville, I have developed a love hate relationship with sports. Now since there isn't any professional sports teams in Louisville, I pretty much had 2 options. I could either be a Louisville fan, or a Kentucky fan. Since my family has mainly been a Louisville fan ever since we've lived in Kentucky, thats the way I went. In my early years, Louisville fans were pretty spoiled. We had a good football and basketball team for a few years, and then some drama came. After a couple rough seasons, some stars rose, and I decided to ride along with them. The 2 players that I follow are Lamar Jackson and Donovan Mitchell. Through following those players, I strated to love football and basketball even more, and that is where I gained my Interest in sports. </p>
